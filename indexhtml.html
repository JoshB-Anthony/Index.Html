      <h1> My name is Joshua Anthony</h1>
      <p> I am currently taking network engineering classes at Wake Tech to hopefully prepare for me for my future career in the networking field. I enjoy rading comic books, playing video games with friends, and taking my dog on long walks at the park. I am currently really enjoying everything we have learned so far in this class, and can't wait to learn more.
